                                Buy frozen fruits and orange juice (would recommend to buy both from Costco!)

                            <li>
                                Get your blender and add 2/3 full with fruits, and from the amount of fruits you added, pour &frac12 of orange juice from that amount. Basically, add less orange juice, about <em>1:2</em> ratio of orange juice to frozen fruits.
                            </li>

                                Pour your smoothie into a bowl, cut up some fruits you have around, and add other toppings like coconut flakes, almonds, chia seeds, and etc...
